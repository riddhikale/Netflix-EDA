# Netflix-EDA

This is a beginner-friendly Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project on the **Netflix dataset** using Python.  
I used **Pandas, Matplotlib, and Jupyter Notebook** to explore and visualize the data.

## Dataset:
- Source: [Netflix Titles on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows)  
- About 8,800 titles with details like type, country, release year, duration, and genre.

## What I Explored:
1. Movies vs TV Shows  
2. Top 10 countries with most content  
3. How Netflix content grew over the years  
4. Distribution of movie durations  
5. Seasons in TV Shows  
6. Popular genres
